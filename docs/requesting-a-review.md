## Submitting a request

Once the researcher has finished working on the release request, the next step is to
submit it for a review by an output checker. Researchers should view the current request
and click "Submit For Review".

The status of the release request will transition to "Submitted".

!!!note "Notifying output checkers"
    :construction: Work in progress :construction:

    Currently, the researcher needs to notify output checkers of the submitted request by email or slack.
    
    In future, output checkers will be automatically notified when new release requests are submitted
    for review.
