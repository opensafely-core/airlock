!!! Note
    This process is under development and currently only applies to release requests
    submitted by internal researchers.


## Submitting a request

Once the researcher has finished working on the release request, the next step is to
submit it for a review by an output checker. Researchers should view the current request
and click "Submit For Review".

The status of the release request will transition to "Submitted".

A GitHub issue will be automatically created and output-checkers will be notified
in Slack of the new release request.


### Completing the release request form

After submitting their request on Airlock, researchers complete [this form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uWRiFps6tDA2SpxSxf0C2G9mOVWMQ6TQ/edit)
and email it to datarelease@opensafely.org, with the subject "Airlock release request".
