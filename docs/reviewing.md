Two output checkers independently review each file and record their decisions using the buttons within Airlock.
Whilst viewing a file in an Airlock release request, they have the option of: 

* **Approve** — output meets disclosure requirements and is safe to be released
* **Reject** — output is not currently acceptable for release. 

!!!warning "Retrictions for authors"
    Airlock does not permit users to approve or reject files that are part of release requests they created themselves.


## Viewing release requests on Airlock

1. After logging into Airlock, output checkers navigate to the Requests list to
   view all open requests awaiting review. Note that if an output checker is the
   author of a request, they will not see it in the outstanding requests list. 
1. Output checkers identify the request by workspace name and requester username. A user
   can have at most one active request per workspace. 
1. Output checkers can view the files included in the request via the file
    browser within Airlock. If required (e.g. in order to perform calculations
    in a spreadsheet), output checkers can also downloaded files from Airlock.

!!! warning "Downloading restrictions" 
    Please note that only request files (not workspace files) can be downloaded.
    Downloading is permitted **only** for the purposes of output checking.
    Request authors are not permitted to download files from their own requests,
    even if they are also output checkers.

## Dealing with discrepancies and rejected files

<!-- Output checkers and researchers can add comments on each file group to request
information and discuss discrepancies. Comments are recorded and displayed on the
file group with the user's username and a timestamp. -->

Researchers should withdraw any files that have been rejected in order for their
release request to progress. They can add further files, including revised versions
of rejected files, and then ask the output checkers for further review.

Files require approval by two output checkers in order to be released. If the two output checkers 
do not agree on whether a file should be approved or rejected,
and there is no way to satisfy the rejecting output checker, it is possible for a
third output checker to supply the second approving review.
