## Security

Airlock allows us to enforce some safety controls and policies automatically. This includes things such as the number of required reviews, independence of reviews, and ensuring that researchers who are also output checkers are not able to review their own requests.

## User experience

Airlock provides a simple way for users to view their workspace files and
build a release request. It reduces the burden on both researchers and output checkers, 
and reduces the risk of user error by automating the workflow and enforcing who is
permitted to act on the request at each stage.

## Audit log

Airlock logs actions taken by users during the life cycle of the request.
