## Permission to view workspace files

Users can view medium privacy outputs from any workspace they have permission to
access (workspaces for which they have the Project Developer role on the Jobs site).


## Withdrawing files
Files can only be withdrawn whilst a release request is in the Pending or Returned states.
If a request is in the Submitted or Reviewed state, it should first be returned to
the author in order to withdraw a file.
Once a request reaches the Approved, Released, Rejected, or Withdrawn states,
files can no longer be withdrawn through this mechanism. If it is necessary
to withdraw a file in this case, please refer to the documentation for
[reporting a data breach](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/#reporting-a-data-breach).
