## Permission to view workspace files

Users can view medium privacy outputs from any workspace they have permission to
access (workspaces for which they have the Project Developer role on the Jobs site).


## Withdrawing files
Files can only be withdrawn whilst a release request is in the Pending or Returned states.
If a request is in the Submitted or Reviewed state, it should first be returned to
the author in order to withdraw a file.
Once a request reaches the Approved, Released, Rejected, or Withdrawn states,
files can no longer be withdrawn through this mechanism. If it is necessary
to withdraw a file in this case, please refer to the documentation for
[reporting a data breach](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/#reporting-a-data-breach).


## Updating files
Files can only be updated by the author of the request, and only during the Pending
or Returned states.
This means that if a request is in the Submitted or Reviewed states, the output
checking team must return the request to the author in order for files to be updated.
Updating a file will reset any reviews associated with that file.

## Retrictions for authors
Airlock does not permit users to approve or request changes to files that are part of release requests they created themselves.

## Downloading restrictions
Please note that only request files (not workspace files) can be downloaded.
Downloading is permitted **only** for the purposes of output checking.
Request authors are not permitted to download files from their own requests,
even if they are also output checkers.
