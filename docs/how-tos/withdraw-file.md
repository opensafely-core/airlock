Files can be withdrawn from a request when it is in an editable state i.e. when it is in
Pending status, and is being constructed prior to initial submission, and when it has been
returned to the author after review.

To withdraw a file, navigate to view the file within the release request,
and use "Withdraw from Request".

After the file has been withdrawn, the file will still be visible on the request, but marked
as withdrawn. It can be re-added from the workspace view, as described in the 
[previous section](create-and-submit-a-release-request.md)
