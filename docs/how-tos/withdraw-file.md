## Withdrawing files

To withdraw a file, researchers select the current release request, navigate to view the file,
and use "Withdraw from Request".

!!!info "Withdrawing files"
    Files can only be withdrawn whilst a release request is in the Pending or Returned states.
    If a request is in the Submitted or Reviewed state, it should first be returned to
    the author in order to withdraw a file.
    Once a request reaches the Approved, Released, Rejected, or Withdrawn states,
    files can no longer be withdrawn through this mechanism. If it is necessary
    to withdraw a file in this case, please refer to the documentation for
    [reporting a data breach](https://docs.opensafely.org/releasing-files/#reporting-a-data-breach).
