navigation bar. This will show you a list of workspaces that you have access to, organised
by Project.

From the file view, the `More` dropdown also allows you to [view the file in alternative ways](../reference/view-files-alt.md), or to [view the source code](../reference/view-source-code.md) underlying
the file.
