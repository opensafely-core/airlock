When all output files in a release request have either been approved by two separate
output checkers or withdrawn, the request can be released to the jobs site.

An output checker navigates to the release request and clicks the "Release Files"
button to start the release process. This button is disabled until all files
in the release request have at least two approvals. The release request transitions
to the "Approved" state. Once all files have been uploaded to the jobs site, the
release request will move to the "Released" state.

Once a release request has been released, it can no longer be updated.
