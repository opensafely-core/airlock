# In production, the airlock docs are also pulled into and built with
# the main docs at https://github.com/opensafely/documentation

# The contents of this mkdocs.yml are ignored in the production build.

# WARNING!
# Most of the rest of this config (see comments for exceptions) is duplicated from the mkdocs.yml
# in the parent repo (https://github.com/opensafely/documentation) in order to build in-airlock docs with
# similar styling. If any changes/additions are needed, ensure they are
# made in the parent repo also.
