# NOTE: This mkdocs.yml contains the minimum config required to run
# Airlock's docs locally and to access them within Airlock itself.
#
# In production, the airlock docs are also pulled into and built with
# the main docs at https://github.com/opensafely/documentation
#
# The contents of this mkdocs.yml are ignored in the production build.

# WARNING!
# The rest of this config is duplicated from the mkdocs.yml in the parent repo
# (https://github.com/opensafely/documentation) in order to build in-airlock docs with
# similar styling. If any changes/additions are needed, ensure they are
# made in the parent repo also.
